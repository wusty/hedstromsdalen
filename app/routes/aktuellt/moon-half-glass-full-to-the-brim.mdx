# moon half – glass full to the brim

![Glass](/img/glass-full-to-the-brim.jpeg)

The series of new works that will be presented, forms an installation introducing
narratives and images composed, re-composed, suggested, sometimes ephemeral,
at times painterly, poetic and ever-evolving in relation with each other’s discourse.
The subjects of the artist&#39;s imagery change in front of our eyes as we observe it,
suggest meanings beyond the most obvious ones and gather symbols and ancestral
shades while speaking about life, death and transformation. The photographs
suggest narratives and meta-narratives and open a liminal yet cogent passage to the
depths of human life and transformation perception, to something else and possible,
beyond,  while the sculptural pieces, their declinations and execution through
natural, recovered and reworked materials invite the public to re-consider the space
of change, decay, representation and transition.

Strömberg’s installation will explore the erasure of evidence through archival
fragments—maps, texts, images—linked to images, places or data, while the very
same fragments function as discursive incipits for alternate narratives of the human
perception of nature and the self. 
By collecting, collaging, over exposing, obscuring and overpainting materials, critical
informations and signifiers result hidden, camouflaging their own existence. The
tension between revealing and concealing is crucial, much as the pull between them.
The artist presents clear glass containers and collages containing objects and
remnants of those, while plaster boards adjusted within the wooden cabin panels
form a &quot;room within a room,&quot; suggesting a veiling/un-veiling act and the renegotiation
of the act of gathering not as simple evidence collection but as a subversive re-
framing of reality, where meaning/s remain fluid.
